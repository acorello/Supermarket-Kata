# Supermarket Kata

Taking inspiration from the [Supermarket Kata] this code implements a basket where you can add and remove items configured in some catalog the basket knows about; and return, list of items, applied discounts, and a grand total showing.

## Current stage

- adding and removing of items
- calculation of a total (without details)
