# Supermarket Kata

Taking inspiration from the [Supermarket Kata](http://codekata.com/kata/kata01-supermarket-pricing/) this code implements a basket where you can add and remove items configured in some catalog and generate a total showing items, discounts, and grand total.

Current stage includes the adding and removing of basket and calculation of a total without details.
